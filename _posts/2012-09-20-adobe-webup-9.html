<p>This time, it was quite short (19:45 - 21:10) with only 2 presentation, both directly related to some cool js libraries.<br />
<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38" title="piatra" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/piatra.png?w=150&amp;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><br />
First presentation was kept by a student(Andrei Oprea), that is an intern at Adobe RO. He presented an online version of tool that resembles with PowerPoint - <a href="http://piatra.jit.su/">http://piatra.jit.su/</a>.<br />
This tool is based on a node.js server with front-end developed using less, jQuery, bootstrap and <a href="http://requirejs.org/"><strong>require.js</strong></a>. About jQuery, less and bootstrap i heard also before, but require.js was the new stuff.</p>
<p><strong>What's require.js?</strong> It's a dependency management library, that can help you a lot in terms of concurrency issues at load(we all had this problem at least once).</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The tool presented is able to generate, as final result, a zip file containing all required files in order to run it on compatible browser( the content and the libraries required + a tiny bash script that will start a python web server ). For the moment it's not able to edit previously created presentation, but  i understood that the maintainer want's to integrate this with git or something similar so you'll be able to save presentation and restore it at a later point for further changes.</p>
<p>The second session was about same require.js library (kept by Alexandru Topliceanu), but this time the software got naked, we've seen some code. We were presented a custom built MVC  based on jQuery, underscorejs ( _ ), bootstrap ( only for graphic part - as presenter said "I'm not a good designer" ) and Backbone.js.</p>
<p>So it seems that today's event celebrity was require.js. A lot of cool features were presented, some of them worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>dependency management - allows to load required components and only after that run the code</li>
<li>helpers for loading various types of data/code and compile them : coffescript, less, json</li>
<li>it offers possibility to compile the entire js code into one single minifed file that will contain the entire code to be run in the correct order. A nice example give by the presenters was the ability to compile coffescript code.</li>
</ul>
<div>You can read more about require.js <a href="http://requirejs.org/">here</a>.</div>
<p>Also we got some preview of what's going to happend in Adobe WebUp #10, there will be a presentation about ruby and Sinatra.</p>

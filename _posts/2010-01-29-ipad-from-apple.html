<p>Recently Apple sent to market <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a>, that wants to be a mobile device and most probably to replace <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Original-Wireless-generation/dp/B000FI73MA/ref=pd_rhf_shvl_1">Amazon's Kindle</a>. We can not state that it's a computer or tablet pc as it's operating system it's almost the same as the one that is on iPhone.</p>
<p>At first look it looks nice, works great(as any other machine with OSX on it), has a bunch of great features, bit it will not replace desktop computers. If we look closer we can say that it's a bigger iPhone(almost same features and interface, but with bigger screen, bigger processor and much more memory).</p>

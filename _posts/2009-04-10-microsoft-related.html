<p>Recently I have received my MAPS(Microsoft Action Pack Subscription) that contains lot of M$ software and, of course, the necesary licenses for using that software. Considering it's only $350/year, i consider it a great deal. For this money i got 10 licences for each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Vista</li>
<li>Microsoft Office 2007</li>
<li>CAL's for the server based products</li>
</ul>
<p>And also got license for a bunch of server products.</p>
<p>Since 2 weeks ago i'm Microsof Certified Professional and i must say that the exam 70-290 has questions that any windows sysadmin should know to answer as long as it got some experience with IIS, AD and other windows features. Also the exam has a few questions about designing a network of computers and also (as expected) licensing questions.</p>
<p>I look forward for the next exam that most probably will be on Active Directory.</p>
